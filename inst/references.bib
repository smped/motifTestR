              colocalization of transcription factors, but the mechanisms
              underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Here, we
              demonstrate in macrophages and B cells that collaborative
              interactions of the common factor PU.1 with small sets of
              macrophage- or B cell lineage-determining transcription factors
              establish cell-specific binding sites that are associated with
              the majority of promoter-distal H3K4me1-marked genomic regions.
              PU.1 binding initiates nucleosome remodeling, followed by H3K4
              monomethylation at large numbers of genomic regions associated
              with both broadly and specifically expressed genes. These
              locations serve as beacons for additional factors, exemplified by
              liver X receptors, which drive both cell-specific gene expression
              and signal-dependent responses. Together with analyses of
              transcription factor binding and H3K4me1 patterns in other cell
              types, these studies suggest that simple combinations of
              lineage-determining transcription factors can specify the genomic

              experiments is the best source of information for inferring the
              relative DNA-binding affinity of these proteins in vivo. However,
              standard motif enrichment analysis and motif discovery approaches
              sometimes fail to correctly identify the binding motif for the
              ChIP-ed factor. To overcome this problem, we propose 'central
              motif enrichment analysis' (CMEA), which is based on the
              observation that the positional distribution of binding sites
              matching the direct-binding motif tends to be unimodal, well
              centered and maximal in the precise center of the ChIP-seq peak
              regions. We describe a novel visualization and statistical
              analysis tool--CentriMo--that identifies the region of maximum
              central enrichment in a set of ChIP-seq peak regions and displays
              the positional distributions of predicted sites. Using CentriMo
              for motif enrichment analysis, we provide evidence that one
              transcription factor (Nanog) has different binding affinity in
              vivo than in vitro, that another binds DNA cooperatively (E2f1),
              and confirm the in vivo affinity of NFIC, rescuing a difficult

              greatly improving statistical power by combining dependent tests

Here, we present an updated database EnhancerAtlas 2.0 (http://www.enhanceratlas.org/indexv2.php), covering 586 tissue/cell types that include a large number of normal tissues, cancer cell lines, and cells at different development stages across nine species. Overall, the database contains 13 494 603 enhancers, which were obtained from 16 055 datasets using 12 high-throughput experiment methods (e.g. H3K4me1/H3K27ac, DNase-seq/ATAC-seq, P300, POLR2A, CAGE, ChIA-PET, GRO-seq, STARR-seq and MPRA). The updated version is a huge expansion of the first version, which only contains the enhancers in human cells. In addition, we predicted enhancer–target gene relationships in human, mouse and fly. Finally, the users can search enhancers and enhancer–target gene relationships through five user-friendly, interactive modules. We believe the new annotation of enhancers in EnhancerAtlas 2.0 will facilitate users to perform useful functional analysis of enhancers in various genomes.}",
