Description: Taking a set of sequence motifs as PWMs, test a set of sequences
  for over-representation of these motifs, as well as any positional features
  within the set of motifs. Enrichment analysis can be undertaken using multiple
  statistical approaches. The package also contains core functions to prepare 
  data for analysis, and to visualise results.
