\title{motifTestR: Perform Key Analyses on Transcription Factor Binding Motifs}
\description{
The package `motifTestR` has been designed for two primary analyses of TFBMs,
testing for positional bias and overall enrichment.
}
\details{
The package `motifTestR` provides two primary functions for testing TFBMs
within a set of sequences

* [testMotifPos()] for detecting positional bias within a set of test
sequences
* [testMotifEnrich()] for testing overall enrichment of a TFBM within a set
of test sequences

The main functions rely on lower-level functions such as:

* [countPwmMatches()] simply counts the number of matches within an
`XStringSet`
* [getPwmMatches()] returns the position of matches within an `XStringSet`
* [makeRMRanges()] which produces a set of random, matching ranges based on
key characteristics of the set of test sequences/ranges

A simple utility function is provided yo enable visualisation of results

* [plotMatchPos()] enables visualisation of the matches within a set of
sequences using multiple strategies
