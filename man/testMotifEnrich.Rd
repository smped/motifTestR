\value{
A data.frame with columns: \code{sequences}, \code{matches}, \code{expected}, \code{enrichment},
and \code{p}, with additional columns \code{Z}, \code{est_bg_rate} (Poisson), \code{odds_ratio}
(Hypergeometric) or \code{Z}, \code{sd_bg}, \code{n_iter} and \code{iter_p} (Iterations).
The numbers of sequences and matches refer to the test set of sequences,
whilst expected is the expected number of matches under the Poisson or
iterative null distribution. The ratio of matches to expected is given as
\code{enrichment}, along with the Z score and p-value. Whilst the Z score is only
representative under the Poisson model, it is used to directly estimate
p-values under the iterative approach.
Under this latter approach, the sd of the matches found in the background
sequences is also given, along with the number of iterations and the p-values
from permutations testing the one-sided hypothesis hypothesis for enrichment.

It may also be worth noting that if producing background sequences using
\link{makeRMRanges} with \code{replace = TRUE} and \code{force_ol = TRUE}, the
iterative model corresponds to a bootstrap, given that the test sequences
will overlap the background sequences and background ranges are able to be
sampled with replacement.

\description{
Test for motif enrichment within a set of sequences using a background set to
derive a NULL hypothesis
}
\details{
This function offers four alternative models for assessing the enrichment of
a motif within a set of sequences, in comparison to a background set of
sequences.
Selection of the BG sequences plays an important role and, in conjunction
with the question being addressed, determines the most appropriate model to
use for testing, as described below.

It should also be noted that the larger the BG set of sequences, the larger
the computational burden, and results can take far longer to return. For
many millions of background sequences, this may run beyond an hour
\subsection{Descriptions of Models and Use Cases}{
\subsection{Hypergeometric Tests}{

Hypergeometric tests are best suited to the use case where the test set of
sequences represents a subset or a larger set, with a specific feature or
behaviour, whilst the BG set may be the remainder of the set without that
feature. For example, the test set may represent ChIP-Seq binding sites
where signal changes in response to treatment, whilst the BG set represents
the sites where no changed signal was observed. Testing is one-sided, for
enrichment of motifs within the test set.

Due to these relatively smaller sized datasets, setting
model = "hypergeometric", will generally return results quickly
}

\subsection{Poisson Tests}{

This approach requires a set of background sequences which should be much
larger than the test set of sequences.
The parameters for a Poisson model are estimated in a per-sequence manner on
the set of BG sequences, and the observed rate of motif-matches within the
test set is then tested using \link[stats]{poisson.test}.

This approach assumes that all matches follow a Poisson distribution, which
is often true, but data can also be overdispersed. Given that this model can
also return results relatively quickly, is it primarily suitable for data
exploration, but not for final results.
}

\subsection{Quasi-Poisson Test}{

The quasipoisson model allows for over-dispersion and will return more
conservative results than using the standard Poisson model.
Under the method currently implemented here, BG sequences should be divided
into blocks (i.e. iterations), identical in size to the test set of sequences.
Model parameters are estimated per iteration across the BG set of sequences,
with the rate of matches in the test being compared against these.

It is expected that the BG set will matched for the features of interest and
chosen using \link{makeRMRanges} with a large number of iterations, e.g.
n_iter = 1000.
Due to this parameterisation, quasipoisson approaches can be computationally
time-consuming, as this is effectively an iterative approach.
}

\subsection{Iteration}{

Setting the model as "iteration" performs a non-parametric analysis, with
the exception of returning Z-scores under the Central Limit Theorem.
Mean and SD of matches is found for each iteration, and used to return Z
scores, with p-values returned from both a Z-test and from comparing
observed values directly to sampled values obatained from the BG sequences.
Sampled values are calculated directly and as such, are limited in precision.

As for the QuasiPoisson model, a very large number of iterations is expected
to be used, to ensure the CLT holds, again making this a computationally
demanding test.
Each iteration/block is expected to be identically-sized to the test set,
and matched for any features as appropriate using \code{\link[=makeRMRanges]{makeRMRanges()}}.
