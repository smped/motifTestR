\usage{
plotMatchPos(
  matches,
  binwidth = 10,
  abs = FALSE,
  type = c("density", "cdf", "heatmap"),
  geom = c("smooth", "line", "point", "col"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{matches}{Output from \link{getPwmMatches}}

\item{binwidth}{Width of bins to use when plotting}

\item{abs}{logical(1) Plot absolute distances from centre}

\item{type}{Plot match density, the CDF or a binned heatmap}

\item{geom}{Type of geom to be used for line plots. Ignored for heatmaps}

\item{...}{Passed to individual geom* functions}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object
}
\description{
Plot the distribution of motif matches across sequences
}
\details{
Multiple options are provided for showing the distribution of PWM matches
within a set of sequences, using either the smoothed probability density,
the probability CDF or as a heatmap.
Distances can be shown as symmetrical around the centre or using absolute distances
from the central position within the sequences.

Heatmaps are only enabled for comparisons across multiple PWMs
}
\examples{
## Load the example PWM
data("ex_pwm")
esr1 <- ex_pwm$ESR1

## Load the example Peaks
data("ar_er_peaks")
library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)
genome <- BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19
seq <- getSeq(genome, ar_er_peaks)

## Just the best match
bm <- getPwmMatches(esr1, seq, best_only = TRUE)
plotMatchPos(bm, se = FALSE)

## Matches can also be shown by distance from centre
plotMatchPos(bm, abs = TRUE)

## Cumulative Probability plots are also implemented
plotMatchPos(bm, type = "cdf", geom = "line", colour = "red") +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0.5, slope = 1/ 400)
